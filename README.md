# Fundamental-Kotlin
This repository is intended to be my kotlin cheatsheet. Kotlin has similarities of other language, such as Java, JS, Python, Swift, and extend feature like C#.

I think it has no essential to have full feature code as Kotlin is very similar to another languange as I mentioned above.
